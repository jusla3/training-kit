Now that you have made some local commits, it is time to send your changes to the remote copy of your repository on GitHub.com:

1. On GitHub Desktop, click the Pull Request button.
1. Complete the fields of the Pull Request just like you would on GitHub.com. Ensure the `base` branch (the one on the left) is `master` and that the `compare` branch (the one on the right) is the one you created on GitHub Desktop.
1. Click `Send Pull Request`. GitHub Desktop will send your changes and create a pull request.
1. You will receive a confirmation message including the link to your Pull Request. Click the link to view your newly created Pull Request on GitHub.com!
