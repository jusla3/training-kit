Now that you have a local copy of the repository, let's use the steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to make a change in your project. First we will create a branch:

1. At the top of GitHub Desktop, click the <i class="fa fa-code-fork fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> button.
1. In the `Name` field, type a meaningful name for your branch. Something like `add-index-page` will work nicely.
1. Click `Create branch`.
1. GitHub Desktop will automatically create your new branch and switch you to it.
