  ## Reviewing the GitHub Flow

  Let's review where we are in the GitHub Flow:

  1. Create a branch
  1. Add commits
  1. **Open a Pull Request** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
  1. Collaborate, and make more commits
  1. Merge the Pull Request

  GitHub Desktop makes it easy to open a Pull Request without leaving the app. However, if you wanted to create the Pull Request on GitHub.com, you would simply click the Publish button. This would send your branch up to GitHub so you could open the Pull Request there!
